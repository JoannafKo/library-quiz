# For the Community: An Interactive Quiz or Tool
This is a quiz to help both novices and Latin students learn about the Latin language
 ## About
More in depth details about the project.
## Process & Documentation
I first got creating a repo over with, because I would forget how to do so later on in the project. Then I looked into a video series about making a quiz or game for HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I followed it while making my own customization

I sprinkled in Latin phrases and words throughout the website, to fit with the language theme. I even tweeked some of them a bit. I took the phrase "ex luna scientia," which means "knowledge from the moon," and turned it into "ex lingua scientia," which means "knowledge from language"

I created a page reserved for the questions. I rant into a bit a trouble with creating the functions, mainly because I mispelled it.

## Challenges & Struggles
First challenge I got involved in was with the folders. I initially tried to catergorize the extra HTML and CSS files into different folders, but when I tried to attatch the style sheet to them, the script wouldn't visually show up. I ultimately gave up on the folders, it made things too complicated.

# For the Community: An Interactive Quiz or Tool
This is a quiz to help both novices and Latin students learn about the Latin language
 ## About
More in depth details about the project.
## Process & Documentation
I first got creating a repo over with, because I would forget how to do so later on in the project. Then I looked into a video series about making a quiz or game for HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I followed it while making my own customization

I sprinkled in Latin phrases and words throughout the website, to fit with the language theme. I even tweeked some of them a bit. I took the phrase "ex luna scientia," which means "knowledge from the moon," and turned it into "ex lingua scientia," which means "knowledge from language"

I created a page reserved for the terminolgies. I rant into a bit a trouble with creating the functions, mainly because I mispelled it. I also considered a page of flashcards, but ultimately decided against it because of time and lack on information on how to create it.

I have thought about using roman numerals instead of numbers, but I passed it over due to time constraints, and that it would be difficult for even the begginer and student to understand the numeric values.


## Challenges & Struggles
First challenge I got involved in was with the folders. I initially tried to catergorize the extra HTML and CSS files into different folders, but when I tried to attatch the style sheet to them, the script wouldn't visually show up. I ultimately gave up on the folders, it made things too complicated.

Another challenge I ran into was fetching API. When I tried to place the array into a JSON file. It mostly worked, except when I tried clicking on the answers of the questions, it did not go to the next questions. It got extremely annoying, as I planned on having about 400 terms and questions. So I decide to just go the hard route.

I also tried adding a pattern to the site, however, when I tried to follow the video tutorial, it did not have the pattern show up, despite tagging it in the body. So I ended up dropping that too. If there is time near the end, I may try and fix it.
